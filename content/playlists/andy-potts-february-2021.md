# Tame Impala

Listening to Tame Impala reminds me of being young, when times were simpler. Love that they're essentially a one man band, Kevin Parker. I've seen Tame Impala live twice and they were great!

# Radiohead

Radiohead's Thom Yorke is a musical genius. The band has a great collection of weird and wonderful songs.

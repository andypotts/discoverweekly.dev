# Thank You Scientist

It's always a pleasure to listen to TYS. A complex yet easy to listen prog rock mixed with jazz fusion vibes that will never fail to amuse me. It's love at first listen!

# The Mars Volta

This band is like having an acid trip without taking drugs ðŸ˜…. It's hard to describe their sui generis sound, since they mix hardcore punk (brought along by their previous band At the Drive-In) with dub and even salsa.

# Plini

Plini is an instrumental act that I like to listen to while I'm coding, since I can't stand other voices in my head while I'm getting through lots of code ðŸ˜†. Plini's sound is a lot more prog metal-oriented than Thank You Scientist's, though lots of his stuff are not so heavy.
